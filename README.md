# Fractals
## 2D Mandelbulb
- The Mandelbulb is a three-dimensional fractal that extends the concept of the Mandelbrot set into three dimensions. However, for initial exploration, I opted to implement a 2D version, which allowed me to grasp the essential algorithms and rendering techniques without the added complexity of 3D calculations. I decided it would be beneficial to familiarize myself with foundational concepts such as **compute shaders**, **coordinate transformations** (from Cartesian to polar), and the **maths** behind fractals.
Here are some of the results that I got after tweaking resolution, zoom and power:

- Here's a little overview on how quick is to explore the fract thanks to compute shader:
